### Bowl Tupperware

This tupperware is an example of a bad design because it doesn’t make use of all the space efficiently since it is circular. The target audience for this seems to be people who are just storing food at home with no intent to carry it around. There isn’t any special seal that could prevent leakage. It is shaped like a bowl with a lid which is very inefficient to travel with since the round ends wouldn’t fit inside a backpack.

The worst part about this tupperware is the fact that it is round and bowl shaped. There aren’t many foods that need to be specifically stored in bowl shaped containers. This takes up a lot of space especially in a refrigerator where things with edges are most compactly stored. This container is also very deep which would make it hard to fit within the shelves. The design where they have the indent to make these containers stackable is clever, but also very useless in daily life.
