# Problem and Solution Overview

The problem we wanted our design to address is the confusion and lack of communication within housing communities. We specifically decided to focus on the lack of social engagement within the residential experience as a barrier for understanding aspects of the housing process due to the lack of communication with administration, facilities, and others in your housing community. While there are spaces across campus for gatherings that can better the residential experience, they are often underutilized and under promoted. The goal of RES is to increase knowledge of these events throughout a college campus to connect individuals within a housing community, and allow them to learn more about their living environments. We plan to achieve this through an event application where people can share events they are hosting and therefore notify others within that quad or neighborhood; facilities and housing authorities will also have access to the application and therefore be informed of these events as well.
