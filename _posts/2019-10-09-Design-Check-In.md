### Recap of Tasks

- Getting in contact with housing authorities - Easy  

- Getting Information on student housing options - Easy

Alex is a 3rd year student who wants to live off campus during their senior year. Alex tries to contact local real estate agents to ask about some of the apartments and houses that current seniors are living in. The real estate agents say that they do not deal with the properties that Alex is interested in but give Alex detailed information about other properties. As Alex looks at this information, they do not understand it and do not know whether the information is sufficient for approval of their request to live off campus by their school. Alex declines the information from the real estate agents and tries to figure out who is living off campus this school year. While they do not know which students these are because they have never met them, they must find a way to get in contact with these seniors to move on in the process of potentially living off campus the following year.

- Creating a social space where you live - Hard

- Give Feedback on your housing - Easy	

Whether it’s housing authorities or just reviewing the place you live in

- Getting To Know Your Neighbors - Hard 

Lily lives in a large dorm but sees how much fun her neighbors seem to have on the weekends and wants to get to know them. She thinks that the best way to get to know these people is over a meal. She does not know any of the people that she was placed in her dorm with, and is too shy to approach them in person. She is unsure of how she should get in contact with these people. Lily does not have a mutual friend to introduce them so thinks of using social media as an alternative. She then realizes that this would be awkward given the fact that her and the people that she wants to get to know don’t even know each other’s names. Lily wishes that there were a way to contact these people on a standard platform where they could recognize that she lives in the same dorm as them if she were to reach out.

- Moving Into a New Place - Moderate

John is a first year student who has just moved into a dorm room for the first time. He realizes that there are items that he will now need to buy himself after he moved in because he was unsure of whether or not they would be provided. Some of these items include hangers, a desk lamp, and a full length mirror. John even needs to buy special tape, instead of the thumbtacks he brought with him, to hang items on his brick walls. He finds a way to get all the items himself once school has started but he is frustrated. John even decides to write a list of all these items so that he can refer to it before moving in the following year. Although, he is unsure of whether his future dorm rooms will provide the same things because he has heard from others who have lived in dorms that include some of the items he has bought for himself this year.

# Design Idea #1: 
This will be a mobile app with a visual directory of all the residents’ profiles that lists contact information, a biography, and also what they like and don’t like about the space they are currently living in. There will be a list of all living spaces associated with the colleges’ students (even off campus apartments). The user will be able to pick which building they want to see and the floor plan will give access to the residents’ profiles. 

### Tasks:

- Getting Information on student housing options (Easy): First, the visual directory will make the user pick what they want to see between on campus and off campus housing. Since there will be a list of buildings/residential halls for each category, the user will be able to explore all the different options in terms of housing. For each building, there will be information about the facilities and resources that are available. The benefit of this design is that the information will be consolidated, easily accessible, and organized by category. 

- Give Feedback on your housing (Easy): Each resident’s profile shows where they are living and how they feel about their current living situation. Having feedback from the current residents makes it more reliable. Users are able to give their honest opinion for future residents, but it will also notify the housing authorities about certain problems they faced. 

- Getting To Know Your Neighbors (Hard): The user would be able to get more information about their neighbors by looking at their residents’ profiles on the floorplan. Since there is the contact information and a biography (listing hobbies, interests, career, major, & etc.), it would make the user have an easier time to connect with the people around them. Through this design, we want to normalize the reaching out process and increase social engagement. 

- Moving Into a New Place (Moderate): Having a contact person that is familiar with the area would be useful when moving into a new place. This could help people gage what they need before the whole moving process. Users could contact current residents with questions to ease this transition. Having buildings’ specifications such as the floorplan, amenities, and facilities beforehand helps the user envision their new residency.
