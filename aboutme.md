My name is Hailey Han, and I am currently a sophomore at Williams College. I grew up in Irvine, California, but am now living in South Korea. I am currently planning to major in Statistics and Economics, but take interest in coding and graphic design. In my free time, I like to cook new recipes and share my homemade food with my friends. I hope to get to know everyone better!
