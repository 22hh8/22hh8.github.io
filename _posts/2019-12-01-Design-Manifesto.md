Human Computer Interaction was my first design course. This was the course that allowed me to appreciate the small details in everyday designs from doors to mobile applications. Before taking this HCI, I didn’t recognize that everything I interact with is designed for me as a user. Now that I am a designer, I am now able to understand how every detail is purposeful.

When designing for a large and diverse population, it is very difficult but necessary to make sure all users are included. Sometimes designers are too focused on the goals that they do not consider how their design can limit users. 
 
### Design is less about the intention, but rather about the perception.

Designs may be intended to complete a certain task, but could isolate users would accessibility needs. Designers should make sure that they are not cutting corners by trying to make designs more efficient. 

This is something my group faced when designing an event sharing application for housing communities (RES). We had intended for our map interface to be intuitive and interactive. 
RES users would constantly be interacting with a map which is helpful as it shows events represented by emojis relative to your location. 

Simply put, we had designed RES with a map interface because it is:
- more efficient than scrolling through a long list.
- More interactive to see events represented by emojis
- Easier to see events relative to your current location

Though we had these intentions, many users with disabilities could perceive our design as being:
- Difficult to interact with due to the overlap of many emojis
- Disorienting because there is so much content (ie. emojis, maps, and words)

This could be too much information on one small screen, especially for dyslexics, autistic users, and users with visual impairments.

I realized that we should implement a list view (other than the search bar) that allows the user to look at the events nearby. This list interface would show the basic details of the events which would help all users since it gives them the option to just scroll through instead of clicking on every emoji. 

Giving the user the option to switch between a map or list view would allow a greater user population. 
 
After understanding the importance of being inclusive in design, I realized that different users have different ways of processing information.

RES was created after identifying the problems of information overload in housing communities. We designed RES so that the events would be better organized for students to use. We quickly learned that “better organized” means different things for people. 

### Organization of information changes depending on the target audience.

The way that text is formatted has a lot to do with the actual content. According to Tondreau in Layout Essentials, information can be organized by defining the spacing, number of columns, amount of words, and colors. For example, the pacing of the book can be determined by these factors, especially when we compare children’s picture books to novels or even dense textbooks. 

After learning these concepts, I want our project to most definitely be on a mobile phone app interface. Though wearable technology is convenient, it limits us from displaying information due to the small screen. 

A clear example of information organization would be the “My Events” page on our RES app. Because our main problem was information overload, we were looking for ways to neatly display the details of the event.

As you can see, the each event has its representative emoji, name, date, start/end time, and location. Organizing them into a column list view with the most upcoming events on top was intentional. It demonstrated a timeline of events the user is interested in. Keeping a visual hierarchy and ordering data by importance is something that we implemented in our design. 

### A characteristic of a good design is one where users don’t second guess their actions. 

Everything is so clearly labeled and actions are intuitive that the user has confidence in every step they make. The most efficient and simple design isn’t one that has the least amount of details. If anything, it is one that is the most descriptive and self-explanatory. It offers clear directions that make it easy for the user to navigate through the design.

Originally, our group was very hesitant to include directions on how to drop a location when creating an event. Having directions seemed to take up a lot of space and we assumed most people know how to use a “drag and drop” pin to mark a location.

As you can see in our initial paper prototype, we just had the pin in the middle of the map so that the user can drag and drop it at any location they want. 

From our Heuristic Evaluations, we were told that having this pin with no directions was very misleading. The users were very hesitant to place the pin anywhere as they didn’t know what the purpose of it was. 

In our second iteration, we added a box that specifically told the user what to do with the pin emoji and how this pin would be used (as a location to create an event). According to our Usability Tests, these directions were helpful and even was a positive incident. 

As designers, I’ve learned that we shouldn’t assume users know how to use our design. In fact, common sense isn’t so common! 

### Pretending to be the user is not enough. 

Something crucial to a design process is to recognize that as much as you are a user, you are first and foremost a designer. As a designer, you see concepts and terms that an average user would not know. 

In our testing process, we conducted a cognitive walkthrough by going through the two different tasks and seeing if each step was intuitive and clearly labeled. At the end of the walkthrough, we realized that we had said each step in our design was intuitive and easily understandable.

This is misleading. Just by looking at this cognitive walkthrough evaluation, it seems as if our design is at its final iteration where no changes need to be made. It seems like a nearly perfect design. 

The catch was that this cognitive walkthrough was done by us, the designers. It was obviously intuitive for us because we were the ones who designed it! 

When we did our Heuristic Evaluations and Usability Testing, we received a lot of critical feedback including unclear instructions and lack of a backspace button. Since the designers created the interface, it is so easy for us to walk through the app and there is no need to add features. 

A key example of this would be when we didn’t realize that we had a back and submit button. Since we knew how to navigate through the app, there was no need for us to press the back button to undo a mistake. We would never make a mistake! Many users pointed out that not having a back button made it harder to complete the task.

After including a back button, users were able to simply go to the previous page and edit details such as a new location without having to completely restart the whole task again. 

### Data should be transparent, but it is the users’ right to be able to control that transparency. 

Throughout the iterative process, we have simplified our tasks to “creating and searching for an event”. Now that our design has been finalized, I have been considering how we could have the task of “contacting housing administration” fit into our design. Initially, our design would send all events to campus security and housing coordinators to guarantee safety. These authorities had the power to cancel events based on their judgment. 

**Who deserves to know?** This is such an important question when talking about data privacy. Our app is aimed to promote safe and social experiences for students in housing communities. 
After learning more about computer ethics, I feel as if sending these events to all housing administration could be a violation of privacy. Students should be able to create social spaces on campus without feeling constantly watched. In fact, the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, states to “respect privacy” and “honor confidentiality”. (1.6 & 1.7). We should give the option to students to post private events, allowing them to keep events private from specific people and administration. 

All in all, I have learned a lot through this course, specifically about how to efficiently and inclusively organize information, and how to truly design for a user. These ideas can be universally applied to everything type of design from physical objects to augmented reality. It is the designers’ duty to guarantee that users are well represented and also protected.
