### Salad Tupperware
This salad tupperware is an example of a good design because it efficiently organizes the different elements of the salad in a compact container. The target audience seems to be people who want a healthier option by meal prepping and people who go to school or work. It is very compact while managing to fit in all the elements necessary which is essential for people who are always on the go. It is also environmentally friendly as the different compartments reduces waste for ziplock bags. 

The most innovative aspect of the tupperware is the different shelves within that compact container. The very bottom compartment is used to hold the salad greens which have the most volume. The second tier has even more organization as it is divided into fourths for extra toppings. In the middle of the second tier, there is a hole for a sauce container which makes use of all the space. This tupperware also comes with buildable utensils that fit inside. The design is simple and suggests that the second tier stacks, but is also removable for more space. The lid also has a 4 way seal which ensures that it is leak-proof.

This design doesn’t necessarily suggest that it is only for salad though it’s been marketed that way. This tupperware can be used for anything, but having those extra storage spaces allows for the user to customize their experience.
