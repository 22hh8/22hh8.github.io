### Summary

To preface, the people we interviewed are a student living off-campus, a past JA who now serves on JAAB, 
and a first-year student. Each contextual inquiry took place in a different setting. For easier reference, 
we will call the student living off-campus A, the student on JAAB B, and the first-year student C. No prompting 
was needed during any of three contextual inquiries. A key finding is that our people seem to have mixed feelings 
about the people they live with. While B and C want to meet and know the people they are living with, A is uninterested. 
A and C both struggled with getting information about their living arrangements; A had trouble getting it from her landlord 
whereas C could not find information on the College’s website. B and C struggled with the larger entry system which 
felt overwhelming for both. The issues shared by A and C seemed to intersect the most because both are people moving 
into new places. Meanwhile, B seemed to share the least in common with C because they are different in two important 
aspects: A lives off-campus and isn’t required to know her roommates whereas B lives on-campus after years of doing so 
and it is his job to bring his roommates/entrymates closer together. Speaking of entries, B and C relate because it is 
both of their first time living in the larger entry system.

### Contextual Inquiry Participants 

A’s contextual inquiry was held in her apartment. We were told that she had difficulty communicating with her 
landlord even before the contract was signed. The landlord was non-receptive to sharing pictures of the apartment 
so person A moved in not knowing what her living space would look like. Additionally, getting in contact with the 
landlord continues to be difficult because all communication is done via text or email. What we noticed during the 
contextual inquiry was the lack of delegation and communication within the apartment. We learned that A’s roommates 
and herself have trouble keeping track of the bills and who paid for certain amenities that month. What was interesting 
about A’s inquiry was her disinterest in knowing some of her roommates, which we thought would be otherwise when we first 
started the project.

Meanwhile, both B and C’s contextual inquiry took place in Mission Park, a first-year dorm. B’s contextual 
inquiry revealed to us that communication and the size of the entry was an issue. The large size of the entry 
system that started with the class of 2022 increased entry sizes from 20 the year before to 40 and as many as 50. 
B struggled with giving individualized attention to his entry of 45 frosh and found communication in the Groupme 
difficult with so many people messaging it at once. During snacks, the common room did not have enough space to 
fit everyone and people needed to stand in spaces next to the common room to semi-participate in the activities.
What was interesting about B’s contextual inquiry was the amount of information taught during his JA training and 
how a portion of it was the resources on campus. Ironically, there’s a poster of that in every first-year dorm’s common 
room, but no one looks at it because it’s too much information and is hard to know which group/person fits their needs.

C’s contextual inquiry focused on her first time living away from home and her lack of information provided by 
the College on her housing situation. Concerns include what will be in the dorm (will she need to bring her own 
garbage can? Mattress? Etc.), the square footage of the dorm, what the dorm looks like, and so forth. For someone 
who has not lived in a college dorm yet, these are reasonable questions, and the College’s lack of pictures of its 
dorms as shown by C during the inquiry further validated those concerns. C also feels uncomfortable sharing a bathroom 
space with the opposite gender and while the entry should be a place of comfort, there are too many names to remember 
and she feels bad for not remembering all of them.
