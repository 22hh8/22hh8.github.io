### Motivations + Problem

Many college residence halls use messaging apps such as GroupMe to engage students in their housing communities. 
These chats often get spammed with messages, so many students don’t actually read the majority of texts, increasing 
the chance of missing out on events. According to [Push Notification Statistics](https://www.businessofapps.com/marketplace/push-notifications/research/push-notifications-statistics/)
researched by PushCrew, 73.47% of their 
users said that they consider push notifications as spam once there were too many notifications (Figure 1).In addition, many 
students are not used to living with housemates, making the transition from home to dorm very difficult. Despite having
meetings and “Snacks”, it is very easy to forget what time quiet hours are or what events are happening in the house.

### What is Dorm Norms? 

This project is an attempt to establish “dorm norms” in an engaging and efficient way, helping 
students learn how to share spaces with each other. The housing coordinator will be the administrator of the 
house on this platform, but each student can tailor their residential hall experience by choosing what type of 
posts they want to get notified for (such as free food, parties, study sessions, & etc). This will guarantee that 
there isn’t a cluttering of push notifications, but also allow students to never miss out on events. Students 
use a calendar to keep up with their academics, but don’t always do the same for social events. GroupMe has a great 
feature that lets users vote on a poll and create calendar events that comes in very useful when communicating with 
many people. We can use this as a starting point to see what elements can be improved. 

### Similar Works


There is a similar social calendar app used by USC students called Highkey (Figure 2). 
It works very well to promote house parties, Greek life, athletic events, and concerts which is 
important to college students. Though it increases traffic to such events, it does not have any aspects that 
can allow students that live in the same dorm to interact with each other.
