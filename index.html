<h1> How do you feel about your housing community? </h1>
<p> We noticed a lack of social engagement within the residential experience.
  Many people described a barrier in the housing process due to the lack of communication with administration, facilities, and others in their housing 
  community. While there are spaces across campus for gatherings that can better the residential experience, 
  they are often underutilized and under promoted. </p>

<h1> Let's Send Out Events! </h1>
<p> The goal of RES is to increase knowledge of these events throughout a college campus to connect 
  individuals within a housing community, and allow them to learn more about their living environments. 
  People can share events they are hosting and therefore notify others within that quad or neighborhood; 
  facilities and housing authorities will also have access to the application and therefore be informed of 
  these events as well.

<h1> Our Design Process </h1>
We used an iterative design process to refine the details of our final design. After understanding the problem, we did various types of research
to become more familiar with the problem and user demographics. Using the feedback from our tests, we went through multiple paper prototypes before creating
our final design. </p> 
<p> Our design went through multiple changes because our original prorotypes did not have 
provide an inuititve interface for our users. This final design was made possible because we experimented with low-fidelity paper prototyping. </p>
