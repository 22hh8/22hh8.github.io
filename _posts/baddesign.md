The Williams Human Resources page is typically used by students and staff to input work hours and to store any data related to employment. Many students only go on it to time-stamp so they can get paid.

When you first enter the website home page, you immediately see all this writing cluttering up all the space. There are so many options that are presented in an extremely tiny font. What makes even less sense is that these options are also on the header, so there should not be a need to have all this out on the main page. There could be some simplifying done.

I personally think that though there are great resources available on the HR website, a lot of it could be hidden so that only the administration can see it. The average daily user does not need to be seeing all this information that only confuses their access to the website.
