### WSO
An example of a good design would be the Williams WSO page. This website is used to give students more information about other students, courses, professors, and even dorms. All this information is nicely organized into categories. The layout of the website is very self explanatory as it has the various headers: Facebook, Factrak, and Dormtrak. Even the naming of these pages make it easy for the user.

The best part about this website is that there are many clues that signal what each page would be about. In the search engine, there are instructions in light gray that tells what the user should input. 

The overall design of this website is very simple and the colors do not clash with each other. The purple color represents the school and the clean, white font catches the eye against the dark background.
